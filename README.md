# Claude Code

Source code for [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/claude-code/overview).

The initial npm release contained sourcemaps, allowing anyone to derive the cli source, but was later removed and overwritten on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@anthropic-ai/claude-code/v/0.2.9?activeTab=code).

This repo contains the [deleted npm release](./@anthropic-ai/claude-code/) and the unbundled sourcemap in [`./src/`](./src/)
